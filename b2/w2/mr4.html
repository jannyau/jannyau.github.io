<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">4</td><td><font size="+1">Fourth, [in order to withstand Satan], we must believe that the ascension of the Lord has put Him far above the power of Satan [Eph. 1:20-22]… The Lord Jesus is already seated in the heavenlies and is far above all the power of Satan. Ephesians 2:6 says, “And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.” This is our position, the position of a Christian. The Lord Jesus is resurrected; He is seated in the heavenlies far above all the power of Satan. We are raised up together with Christ and are seated together with Him in the heavenlies, far above all the power of Satan. (CWWN, vol. 50, “Messages for Building Up New Believers (3),” p. 740)</td><td><font size="+1">第四，我們要〔抵擋撒但，就要〕相信主的升天遠超過撒但的能力〔弗一20 ～ 22〕。…主耶穌已經坐在諸天界裏，遠超過撒但一切的能力。…以弗所二章六節：『祂又叫我們在基督耶穌裏一同復活，一同坐在諸天界裏。』這是我們基督徒的地位。主耶穌是復活了，坐在諸天界裏，遠超過撒但一切的能力；我們與祂一同復活，一同坐在諸天界裏，也與祂一同遠超過撒但一切的能力（初信造就下册，二二六頁）。</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">5</td><td><font size="+1">Ephesians 2 shows us that we are seated together with the Lord in the heavenlies. Chapter 6 shows us that we need to stand firm [vv. 11, 13]… To sit means to rest. It means that the Lord has overcome and that we can now rest in His victory… To stand means that spiritual warfare is not a matter of assault but of defense… Because the Lord has overcome completely, we have no need to attack again. The victory of the cross is complete, and there is no further need to attack. Here we see two attitudes: One is to sit, and the other is to stand. To sit is to rest in the Lord’s victory, while to stand is to withstand Satan and to stop him from taking away our victory.</td><td><font size="+1">以弗所二章給我們看見，我們是與主一同坐在諸天界裏；六章給我們看見，我們要站立得住〔11、13〕。…坐的意思是休息，休息的意思是主已經得勝了，我們可以安息在主的得勝上。…〔站的〕意思就是說，這一個屬靈的爭戰不是進攻，乃是抵擋。…因爲主耶穌已經完全得勝了，用不着我們再進攻了。十字架的得勝是完全的，沒有甚麼再需要我們去進攻的了。所以，我們在這裏可以看見兩個態度：一個是坐，一個是站。坐是靠着主的得勝，站是抵擋撒但，不讓撒但奪去我們的得勝。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">6</td><td><font size="+1">Christian warfare is a matter of warding off defeat; it is not a matter of fighting for victory. We have already overcome. We fight from the position of victory, and we fight to maintain our victory… We fight from victory; victory is something that is in our hands. The warfare spoken of in Ephesians is the warfare of the overcomers. We do not become overcomers through fighting. We need to distinguish between these two things.</td><td><font size="+1">基督徒的爭戰，乃是爲着免去失敗，不是爲着爭取得勝。我們是已經得勝了，我們是從得勝出去爭戰，爲要保守已有的得勝。…我們是從得勝打出去，得勝是已經在我們手裏的東西。以弗所書所說的爭戰，乃是得勝者的打仗，不是藉着爭戰來作得勝者。我們必須分別這一個。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">7</td><td><font size="+1">How does Satan tempt us? He causes us to forget our own position and our victory. He blinds our eyes to our own victory. If we give in to his tactics, we will feel that victory is far away and beyond our reach. We must remember that the victory of the Lord is complete… Once we believe, we overcome. Satan is defeated, and we have overcome in Christ. Satan wants to steal away the victory which we have gained. His work is to taunt us to secretly find out if we still have the faith. If we do not know that victory is already ours, we will fail. But if we know our victory, his work will fail.</td><td><font size="+1">撒但怎樣試探你？撒但是要叫你忘記你自己的地位，叫你忘記你自己的得勝，或者看不見你自己的得勝。你如果接受他這樣的試探，你就越過越覺得得勝離你很遠，越過越摸不着得勝。我們要記得，主耶穌的得勝是完全〔的〕，…你一信就得勝。撒但乃是已經失敗的，我們乃是已經在基督裏面得勝的。撒但想要來偷去我們…所已經得着的得勝。撒但所有的工作都不過是偷偷的來試探我們，看看我們有信心沒有信心。如果我們不知道我們所已經得着的得勝，那我們就要失敗；如果我們曉得我們是得勝的，他就不能作甚麼。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">8</td><td><font size="+1">Therefore, we counter the work of Satan with the work of the Lord Jesus. We withstand Satan through the Lord’s manifestation, death, resurrection, and ascension. We are standing today upon the accomplished work of the Lord. We do not need to try to overcome in any way when Satan attacks us. Once we have the slightest thought of trying to overcome, we have failed, because our position is wrong. How great is the difference between a person who tries to overcome and one who withstands by knowing that he has already overcome. To withstand the devil means that we withstand him by the victory of Christ.</td><td><font size="+1">所以，我們是藉着主耶穌的工作來對付撒但的工作，我們是藉着祂的顯現，藉着祂的死，藉着祂的復活，藉着祂的升天來抵擋撒但。我們今天是站在主所成功的一切工作上。如果撒但來攻擊你，你千萬不要有一點意念想要得勝；你只要有一點『我要得勝』的感覺，你就已經失敗了，因爲這一個地位是錯的。一個人想要得勝，與一個人知道自己已經得勝而去抵擋，這裏面的分別不知道有多大。抵擋魔鬼的意思，就是靠着主的得勝來抵擋。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">9</td><td><font size="+1">This matter indeed needs revelation. We need to see the manifestation of the Lord. We need to see His death, resurrection, and ascension. We need to know all these things. As Christians, we must learn to withstand the devil… May God be gracious to us so that we may all have such a faith. May we have faith toward the four things the Lord has accomplished for us, and may we exercise strong faith to withstand Satan and reject his work upon us. (CWWN, vol. 50, “Messages for Building Up New Believers (3),” pp. 740-742)</td><td><font size="+1">這一件事的的確確需要啓示。我們必須看見主的顯現，我們必須看見主的死、…復活、…升天，這一切我們都必須知道。…我們基督徒要學習如何抵擋魔鬼。…但願神施恩給我們，使我們都能有這樣的信心，相信主替我們成功的四件事，用堅固的信心抵擋撒但，不讓撒但在我們身上作甚麼（初信造就下册，二二六至二二八頁）。</td></tr>
