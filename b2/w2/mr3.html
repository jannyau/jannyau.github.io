<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">16</td><td><font size="+1">God’s Word shows us clearly that the way to withstand Satan is by faith [1 Pet. 5:8-9]… What should our faith rest on? How should we exercise our faith to withstand him? First, we must believe that the Lord was manifested for the purpose of destroying the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). The Son of God has come to the earth; He was manifested. When He was on earth, He destroyed the work of the devil wherever He went. Often Satan’s work was not obvious; he hid behind natural phenomena. However, the Lord rebuked him every time. It is clear that He was rebuking Satan when He rebuked Peter’s speaking (Matt. 16:22-23), when He rebuked the fever of Peter’s mother-in-law (Luke 4:39), and when He rebuked the winds and the waves… Wherever the Lord went, the power of the devil was shattered. This is why He said, “But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you” (Matt. 12:28). In other words, wherever the Lord went, Satan was cast out, and the kingdom of God was manifested. Satan could not remain where the Lord was.</td><td><font size="+1">神的話彀清楚的給我們看見，抵擋撒但的方法在乎信〔彼前五8 ～ 9〕。…我們到底要信甚麼，應當怎麼樣用信心抵擋他呢？…第一，我們要相信主的顯現爲要消除魔鬼的作爲（約壹三8）。神的兒子已經來到地上，祂已經顯現了。祂在地上的時候，沒有一次遇見魔鬼的工作而不破壞它的。有許多時候，撒但的工作並不是明顯的作的，乃是躲在許多天然事情的後面作的，但主耶穌也沒有一次不責備他。當主責備彼得的說話（太十六22 ～ 23），當祂責備彼得岳母的熱病，當祂責備暴風浪的時候。…祂到那裏，那裏就沒有鬼魔的力量。所以，主說，『我若靠着神的靈趕鬼，這就是神的國臨到你們了。』（十二28）換句話說，主耶穌所在的地方，就是撒但被趕出去的地方，也就是神的國所在的地方。主耶穌在那裏，撒但就不能在那裏。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">17</td><td><font size="+1">We should also believe that in manifesting Himself on the earth, the Lord not only destroyed the works of the devil, but also gave authority to His disciples to cast out demons in His name… (cf. Luke 10:19). He gave His name to the church so that His church might continue His work on earth after His ascension. The Lord used His authority on earth to cast out demons. He also gave this authority to the church. No matter how great Satan’s power is, the Lord’s authority is able to overcome him. We must believe that God has given this authority to the church. The church can cast out demons and withstand the devil in the name of the Lord Jesus.</td><td><font size="+1">我們還應該相信一件事，就是當主在地上顯現的時候，祂不只消除魔鬼的作爲，並且還給門徒權柄，叫他們奉祂的名去趕鬼。…（參路十19）。主升天以後，又將祂的名交給召會，叫祂的召會繼續祂在地上的工作。主在地上用權柄趕鬼，主也將這一個權柄交給召會。…不管撒但有多大能力，主的權柄都能勝過他。我們要相信，神已經把這權柄賜給召會，召會奉主耶穌的名能彀趕鬼，召會奉主耶穌的名能彀抵擋魔鬼。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">18</td><td><font size="+1">Second, we must believe that through death the Lord Jesus has destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil (Heb. 2:14). Third, we must believe that the Lord’s resurrection has put Satan to shame. Satan no longer has any way to attack us. To withstand Satan, every child of God must declare with a strong faith, “Thank God, I have resurrected! Satan,… what you can do goes only so far as death. But the life that I have today… has been tested by you already… You are powerless! This life has transcended over you! Satan, get away from me!”</td><td><font size="+1">第二，我們要相信，主耶穌已經藉着死廢除了那掌死權的魔鬼（來二14）。…第三，我們要相信，主的復活叫撒但蒙羞，叫撒但沒有方法攻擊我們。…每一個神的兒女抵擋撒但的時候，都要用堅固的信心宣告說，『感謝神，我已經復活了！撒但，…你所能作的只到死爲止。可是我今天所有的生命…已經給你試驗過，…你沒有用！這一個生命是超越過你的！撒但，你退去罷！』</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">19</td><td><font size="+1">We must not be afraid of Satan. If we are afraid of Satan, he will laugh at us. He will say, “What a fool there is on earth. How can this one be so foolish?” Anyone who is afraid of Satan is foolish, because he has forgotten his position in Christ. We have no reason to fear him. We have transcended over his power. We can stand before him and say, “You cannot touch me! No matter how strong and resourceful you are, you are still one step behind!” On the day of the Lord’s resurrection, He led the enemy captive and openly shamed him. Today we are standing on the ground of resurrection, and we triumph through the cross! (CWWN, vol. 50, “Messages for Building Up New Believers (3),” pp. 734-737, 739-740)</td><td><font size="+1">我們不要懼怕撒但。我們如果懼怕撒但，撒但會在那裏譏笑我們：『世界上竟然有這樣笨的人，笨到這樣的地步！』要知道，任何懼怕撒但的人，都是愚昧的，都是忘記了他在基督裏的地位。我們沒有理由怕他，我們是超越過他的能力的。我們能站在他面前說，『你摸不着我！不管你多有辦法，不管你多有力量，你總是差了一步！』在主復活的那一天，主已經把仇敵擄掠了，主已經明明的羞辱他了。今天我們是站在復活的地位上仗着十字架誇勝！（初信造就下册，二一八至二二○、二二三至二二六頁）</td></tr>
