Hebrews 11:1 says, “Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen”; the word substantiation means the capacity to make something real (colors are substantiated by our eyes, sounds by our ears, etc.); thus, it is one thing for objects to exist, and it is another thing for these things to be substantiated.</td><td><font size="+1">一 希伯來十一章一節說，『信就是所望之事的質實，是未見之事的確證』；『質實』這辭意卽有一種的本能，能把一件東西顯爲實在（眼睛把顏色顯爲實在，耳朵把聲音顯爲實在等）；所以，東西的存在是一件事，把東西質實出來，又是一件事。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">3</td><td><font size="+1">B. All of God's facts recorded in the Bible are real; however, these facts can be substantiated only by faith, because faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</td><td><font size="+1">二 聖經所記載一切神的事實，都是真實的，但是只有信心纔能把這些事實質實出來，因爲信是所望之事的質實，是未見之事的確證。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">4</td><td><font size="+1">C. We need faith to substantiate a spiritual, divine fact, just as we need eyes, ears, and hands to substantiate physical objects; faith is not a mental understanding of a truth; it is the seeing of a divine fact and the substantiation of it; the accomplished facts of Christ's person, living, and work must be substantiated by us; that is, they must be made real to us.</td><td><font size="+1">三 我們需要信心來把一件屬靈、神聖的事實質實出來，像我們需要眼睛、耳朵、手，來把物質的東西質實出來一樣；信心不是頭腦裏明白一項真理；信心乃是看見了一項神聖的事實，而把那件事實質實出來；我們需要把關於基督身位、生活和工作所成功的事實都質實出來，亦卽使其對我們成爲真實的。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">5</td><td><font size="+1">D. Believing is exercising our spirit of faith (2 Cor. 4:13) to substantiate the divine facts; once we believe by saying Amen to God's word, we substantiate the divine facts, and we have them; Amen does not mean a wish for something to be accomplished, but a declaration that it will surely be accomplished, and that there is no doubt about it; when we believe, we are accepting what the Lord has already promised to do.</td><td><font size="+1">四 相信乃是運用我們信心的靈（林後四13）來質實神聖的事實；我們一『阿們』神的話而相信，就能把神聖的事實質實出來，一信，就得着了；『阿們』並非但願這事如此成就，乃是宣告這事必定如此成就，沒有一點疑惑；我們一相信，就接受神所已經應許要作的。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">6</td><td><font size="+1">II. Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth (Heb. 11:1), which is the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy:</td><td><font size="+1">貳 信是對真理本質的質實（來十一1），這真理乃是神新約經綸內容的實際：</td></tr>

Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it—2 Pet. 1:1; cf. Col. 1:12.</td><td><font size="+1">一 這樣的信分給所有在基督裏的信徒，作了他們的分，對所有領受的人都同等寶貴—彼後一1，參西一12。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">8</td><td><font size="+1">B. As such a portion from God, this faith is objective to us in the divine truth, but it brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all, with itself (faith), subjective to us in our experience.</td><td><font size="+1">二 作爲這樣從神來的分，這信在神聖的真理上對我們是客觀的；但這信把所質實的一切內容帶進我們裏面，因而使這些內容連同這信的本身，在經歷中對我們成了主觀的。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">9</td><td><font size="+1">C. It is like the scenery (truth) and the seeing (faith) being objective to the camera (us); but when the light (the Spirit) brings the scenery to the film (our spirit) within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to the camera.</td><td><font size="+1">三 這好比風景（真理）和看見（信）對於照相機（我們）是客觀的，但是當光（那靈）把風景帶到照相機裏的底片（我們的靈）上，看見和風景對於照相機就成了主觀的。</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">12</td><td><font size="+1">Hebrews 11:1 speaks of the importance of faith. This is the only verse in the whole Bible that gives the definition of faith… The word substantiation means the capacity to make something real. For example, we have the shape of the lamps, the color of the walls, and the sound of the organ. How can these shapes, colors, and sounds become real to us?… Different objects have different shapes: some are cubic, while others are spherical, flat, triangular, or curved. One can only substantiate these shapes by the vision of the eyes or the touch of the hands. Therefore, it is one thing for objects to exist, and it is another thing for the existence of these things  to be substantiated. There are millions of objects on the earth, but all of them are dependent upon a certain ability in order to be substantiated. The same is true with faith. (CWWN, vol. 24, “The Overcoming Life,” pp. 115-116)</td><td><font size="+1">希伯來十一章一節講到信心的緊要。全本聖經只有這一節，講到信心的定義。…『質實』這個辭…意卽有一種的本能，能把一件東西顯爲實在。比方這裏有燈的形狀、牆的顏色、風琴的聲音，這些形狀、顏色、聲音，我們有甚麼方法把它顯爲實在呢？…物體的形狀，有方的、有圓的、有平面的、有三角的、有曲線的，必須用手摸，或者用眼看，纔能知道它的實在。所以，東西的存在是一件事，把東西的存在質實出來，又是一件事。世界上有許多的東西，都需要有一種本能來質實它的實在。信心也是這樣（得勝的生命，一三五至一三六頁）。</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">13</td><td><font size="+1">All of God’s facts are real. However, these facts of God can only be substantiated by faith, because faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. The Lord has died and shed His blood on the cross for all men. This is a fact. But some have the faith to substantiate this fact of the Lord’s death, and they receive the benefit from it. Some do not have the faith. The death of the Lord on the cross is still a fact, but they are unable to experience it.</td><td><font size="+1">所有神的事實，都是真實的，但是只有信心纔能把神的事實質實出來。因爲信是所望之事的質實，是未見之事的確證。…主在十字架上流血爲世人死，這是事實。但…有的人有信心，能把主在十字架上死了的事實質實出來，叫他自己得着好處。有的人沒有信心，主死在十字架上，是一個事實，不過他還不能得着這個經歷。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">14</td><td><font size="+1">We need faith to substantiate a spiritual fact just as we need eyes, ears, and hands to substantiate physical objects. In spiritual matters, we need faith to substantiate the reality of everything. The hand substantiates the shape of objects, and the ear perceives sound, but the hand cannot feel nor can the ear hear colors. Colors can only be substantiated by the eyes. This is also true with spiritual matters. For example, the Lord is the Head and we are the members. This union is a fact, and there is no possibility of any separation. In the same way, the Lord is the vine and we are the branches, and there is no possibility of separation. If we believe this, we will receive the benefit of this fact. Some people confess that the Lord is the vine and we are the branches. But they do not have the juice, the life. They cannot bear fruit because they do not have faith.</td><td><font size="+1">我們需要信心來把一件屬靈的事實質實出來，像我們需要眼睛、耳朵、手，來把物質的東西質實出來一樣。在屬靈的事上，必須用信心來質實那東西的實在。手能把物質的形狀質實出來，耳朵能聽聲音。但手不能摸顏色，耳朵也不能聽顏色；顏色只能用眼睛把它質實出來。屬靈的事，也是一樣的實在。例如：主是頭，我們是肢體，這個聯合是事實，無法再分開了。主是葡萄樹，我們是枝子，也是這麼一回事。你信這個，你就能得着這好處。有的人也說主是葡萄樹，我們是枝子，但他沒有汁水，沒有生命，也不會結果子，因爲他沒有信心。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">15</td><td><font size="+1">What is faith? It is not a mental understanding of a truth. It is the seeing of a fact and the substantiation of it… We have heard that the Lord Jesus is our life and living within us, and we may even agree with others that He is our life and living within us. Yet this alone cannot substantiate these facts… We should still substantiate Christ… It only takes a second, and the accomplished facts of Christ will be substantiated in us.</td><td><font size="+1">甚麼叫信心呢？信心不是頭腦裏明白一件真理。信心乃是看見了一件事實，能把那件事實質實出來。…你聽說主耶穌是你的生命，是活在你裏面；不錯，你也說主耶穌是我的生命，是活在我裏面。但是，你還是不能把這些事實質實出來。…你還得…把基督質實出來。…只要一秒鐘，基督所成功的事實，都能在你身上質實出來。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">16</td><td><font size="+1">The problem today is that we have heard that the Lord Jesus is the Head, yet we still pray for Him to be our Head. Why would we not rather thank and praise Him, saying, “Lord, You are the Head”? If we would do this, the fact would be substantiated immediately. (CWWN, vol. 24, “The Overcoming Life,” pp. 117-120)</td><td><font size="+1">今天的難處就在這裏：聽說主耶穌是頭，但是，還求主說，『主阿，求你作我的頭。』你爲甚麼不感謝讚美主說，『主阿，你是我的頭』？如果這樣，你就立刻把事實質實出來了（得勝的生命，一三七至一三八、一四○至一四一頁）。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td width="5%"><font size="+3">17</td><td><font size="+1">If we want to overcome, we have to lay hold of the Word God has given to us and use it as our handle. When we finish our prayer, or when we like what others pray, we say, “Amen”… We think that amen means “may such a thing be accomplished.” But Mr. Gordon said that the word amen does not mean a wish for something to be accomplished, but a declaration that it will surely be accomplished, and that there is no doubt about it… Today many believers do not understand God’s promise, His fact, and His Word. They beg desperately according to their feelings, but do not receive anything. What they lack is faith. (CWWN, vol. 9, p. 343)</td><td><font size="+1">我們如果要得勝，我們就必須將神所給我們的話語，當作把柄抓住。我們祈禱完了，或是聽別人祈禱，很合你意思的時候，就說『阿們』。…我們以爲『阿們』的意思，是但願這事這樣成就。戈登（Gordon）先生說，『「阿們」並非但願這事如此成就，乃是宣告這事必定如此成就。沒有一點疑惑。』…現今有許多信徒，不明白神的應許、事實和話語，只憑着自己的感覺苦求，卻得不着。因爲缺少的是信心（倪柝聲文集第一輯第九册，一五○頁）。</td></tr>
