<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">1</td><td><font size="+1">VII. “Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in falling away from the living God. But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called ‘today,' lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin…‘Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts'”—Heb. 3:12-13, 15a:</td><td><font size="+1">柒 『弟兄們，你們要謹慎，免得你們中間，或有人存着不信的惡心，將活神離棄了。總要趁着還有稱爲「今日」的時候，天天彼此相勸，免得你們中間有人被罪迷惑，心就剛硬了。「你們今日若聽見祂的聲音，就不可硬着心」』—來三12 ～ 14 上：</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">2</td><td><font size="+1">A. Falling away also means “turning away”; when we exercise our spirit of faith and keep our heart turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away, and we can behold Him as the God of glory with an unveiled face, so that we may be continually transfused with Him, with His believing element, so that we can live by Him as our faith and remain in the process of being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree of glory into the same image of the resurrected and glorified Christ—2 Cor. 4:13; 3:16-18; cf. Gen. 1:26; Isa. 43:7.</td><td><font size="+1">一 『離棄』也有『轉離』的意思；當我們運用信心的靈，一直使我們的心轉向主，帕子就除去了，我們就能以沒有帕子遮蔽的臉，觀看祂這位榮耀的神，使我們不斷得着祂同祂信之元素的灌注，好叫我們能因祂作我們的信而活，留在漸漸變化的過程裏，從一種程度的榮耀，達到另一種程度的榮耀，而成爲與復活並得榮之基督同樣的形像—林後四13，三16 ～ 18，參創一26，賽四三7。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">3</td><td><font size="+1">B. We need to see that unbelief is the greatest sin; we are believers who walk by faith and not by sight (2 Cor. 5:7); a believer is one who does not trust in things that can be seen, but he takes certain unseen things, confesses them, and realizes them by faith.</td><td><font size="+1">二 我們需要看見，不信是最大的罪；我們是信徒，行事爲人是憑着信心，不是憑着眼見（林後五7）；信徒不信靠看得見的事物，乃是接受一些看不見的事物，承認這些事物，憑信實化這些事物。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">4</td><td><font size="+1">C. We overcome the devil, the accuser of the brothers, by our declaration of the divine facts, which is the word of our testimony (Rev. 12:10- 11); we follow the Lord as the One who confronted the enemy not by His own word but by repeatedly saying, “It is written…”—Matt. 4:4, 7, 10.</td><td><font size="+1">三 我們勝過魔鬼，那控告我們弟兄的控告者，是藉着宣告神聖的事實，就是我們自己所見證的話（啓十二10 ～ 11）；我們乃是跟從主，祂抵擋仇敵，不是用自己的話，乃是一再的說，『經上記着…』—太四4、7、10。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">5</td><td><font size="+1">D. We should not believe in our feelings but believe in the divine facts in God's holy Word; we must learn to declare the divine, mystical, and eternal facts of what the Lord has done, is doing, and will do in us, for us, and through us for the accomplishment of His eternal economy; when God says a certain thing, we should also speak that thing simply because the Bible tells us so.</td><td><font size="+1">四 我們不該相信自己的感覺，乃該相信神聖言中的神聖事實；我們必須學習宣告主在我們裏面、爲着我們並藉着我們所作成的，所正在作的，以及將要作的這些神聖、奧祕、永遠的事實，以完成祂永遠的經綸；神說一件事的時候，我們也該簡單的說那一件事，因爲聖經這樣告訴我們。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">6</td><td><font size="+1">VIII. As people of faith, we are people of “today”; the first point of the up-to-date way to practice the Lord's present move is to be filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly, essentially and economically, for our life and our work “today”—Acts 2:4; 13:52; Heb. 3:7-8a, 13, 15; 4:7:</td><td><font size="+1">捌 我們這些有信心的人乃是『今天』的人；實行主當前行動最新的路，頭一點乃是我們爲着『今天』的生活和工作，裏裏外外、在素質和經綸上被那靈充滿並充溢—徒二4，十三52，來三7 ～ 8 上、13 ～ 14，四7：</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">7</td><td><font size="+1">“Forget about yesterday's enjoyment of Christ. You need a fresh enjoyment. You need something up to date. The Lord was there in Elden hall, but He is not there now. He is here presently moving in His recovery, and He is in you. Wherever you are, He is in you, and He is in you right now. Do you believe that He is repeating all the things He did in the past? He is not repeating anything. He is always going on and on and on. The Lord is working. He is moving.</td><td><font size="+1">『忘記昨天對基督的享受罷。你需要新鮮的享受，你需要當今最新的東西。那時候主在艾爾登會所，但如今祂不在那裏。祂現今在祂的恢復中行動，祂也在你裏面。不論你在那裏，祂都在你裏面，祂現今就在你裏面。你相信祂會重複祂已過所作的一切事麼？祂不重複任何事，祂一直往前又往前。主正在作工，祂正在行動。</td></tr>

With some people every day is tomorrow, and with others every day is yesterday…Do not look ahead to the future, and do not look back to the past. We are people of today. Do not talk about your old experiences in the past. Talk about your experience today… Every day is a today. We do not have yesterday. We had yesterday, but we do not have it now. We will never have tomorrow. All the time we have is today. Every day is a today. When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we will have today since every day in eternity is today. The only day we have is today. Be filled inwardly [with the Spirit] today. Be filled outwardly [with the Spirit] today. Be filled today." (The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1985, vol. 5, "The Way to Practice the Lord's Present Move," pp.484-485).</td><td><font size="+1">『你是一個昨天的人麼？我們都該是今天的人。每天都是一個今天。有些人的每天是明天，有些人的每天是昨天。…不要往前看將來，也不要回顧已往；我們是今天的人。不要談論你已過的老經歷，要談你今天的經歷。…每天都是一個今天！我們沒有昨天，我們過去有昨天，但如今我們沒有昨天。我們也絕不會有明天。我們所擁有的時間只有今天，每天都是一個今天！當我們進入新耶路撒冷，我們所有的乃是今天，因爲永世裏的每天都是今天。我們惟一擁有的日子乃是今天。今天要在裏面被〔那靈〕充滿！今天要在外面被〔那靈〕充溢！今天要被充滿！』（李常受文集一九八五年第五册，實行主當前行動之路，五九○至五九一頁）</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">11</td><td><font size="+1">As Christians, we need to live by faith and walk by faith, not by appearance (2 Cor. 5:7). We are believers, not those who walk by sight… A believer is one who does not trust in things that can be seen, but he takes certain unseen things, confesses them, and realizes them by faith. To be one who walks according to feelings is even worse than being one who walks by sight… Feelings are not trustworthy. You may feel that you are wonderful, but your condition may be pitiful. Do not believe in your feelings—believe in the facts. It is a fact that we all have been brought into God. The processed Triune God is the very element with which we have been constituted… When God says a certain thing, you should also speak that thing simply because the Bible tells you so. The Bible reveals that God has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit as the constituting element. The Bible says this, and we must believe it. (Life-study of 2 Corinthians, pp. 87-88)</td><td><font size="+1">我們基督徒的生活行事必須是憑着信心，不是憑着眼見（林後五7）。我們是信徒，不是憑眼見生活行事的人。…信徒不信靠看得見的事物，乃是接受一些看不見的事物，承認這些事物，憑信實化這些事物。一個照着感覺生活行動的人，甚至不如憑着眼見行事爲人的人。…感覺是不可靠的。你也許覺得自己很好，但你的光景可能很可憐。不要相信你的感覺—要相信事實。我們都已經進入神裏面，這是事實。經過過程的三一神，正是構成我們的元素。…神說一件事的時候，你也該簡單的說那一件事，因爲聖經這樣告訴你。聖經向人啓示，神已經經過了成爲肉體、人性生活、釘十字架、復活的過程，如今祂在復活裏乃是那賜生命的靈，住在我們的靈裏，作了構成我們的元素。這是聖經的話，我們必須相信（哥林多後書生命讀經，九九頁）。</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+1">12</td><td><font size="+1">The facts are recorded in the New Testament. This testament is a will, something stronger and better than a covenant. A covenant is an agreement similar to a contract. But a testament, a will, refers to something already accomplished… The New Testament is a will. This will says that the processed God is now in us, that He is our portion, and that He is the element with which we have been constituted… We need to believe this fact, just as we believe that we are children of God. Sometimes the devil says, “Look at yourself. Are you a son of God? How can you say you are a son of God when you lost your temper this morning?”… We should say, “Satan, even though I have lost my temper many times, I am still a son of God. Losing my temper does not change the fact that I am a son of God. Satan, with my declaration of this fact, I chase you away.” (Life-study of 2 Corinthians, p. 88)</td><td><font size="+1">這些事實乃是記載在新約裏。這新約乃是遺命，比一般的約定更堅實，也更美好。約定是一種類似合同的協議，但新約這遺命是指一些已經完成的事。…新約乃是遺命。這遺命說，經過過程的神如今在我們裏面，祂是我們的分，祂也是構成我們的元素。…我們必須相信這個事實，正如我們相信自己是神的兒女一樣。有時候魔鬼會說，『看看你自己，你是神的兒子麼？你早晨還發了脾氣，怎麼能說你是神的兒子？』…我們應當說，『撒但，卽使我發了許多次脾氣，我還是神的兒子。發脾氣不會改變我是神兒子的事實。撒但，我宣告這個事實，我要把你趕走。』（哥林多後書生命讀經，九九至一○○頁）</td></tr>
