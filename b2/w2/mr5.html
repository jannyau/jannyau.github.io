<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+3">18</td><td><font size="+1">Faith first gives us access into grace, then a solid standing in grace. Grace is the Triune God Himself, processed that we may enter into Him and enjoy Him… Grace is the realm in which we stand… When we sense that we have moved from the realm of grace into another sphere, we should pray, “Lord, forgive me. Bring me back to the realm of grace.” We return to the realm of grace by the same way through which we entered it originally… through justification by faith. God’s justification brought us into this grace in which we stand. Whenever we act wrongly and sense that we are out of grace, we must pray: “O Lord, forgive me. Cleanse me with Your precious blood.” When we do this, we will be brought back to grace instantly. (The Conclusion of the New Testament, pp. 3036-3037)</td><td><font size="+1">信首先帶我們進入恩典，接着使我們堅定的站在恩典中。恩典乃是三一神自己經過種種過程，給我們進入並享受。…恩典是我們所站的範圍。…當我們覺得自己已從恩典的範圍遷入另一個領域，我們該禱告：『主，赦免我。將我帶回恩典的範圍。』我們回到恩典範圍的路，與我們原初進入恩典的路一樣，…〔就是〕藉着本於信得稱義。…神的稱義將我們帶進我們所站的這恩典中。每當我們行爲不當，並覺得我們在恩典之外，我們就必須禱告：『主阿，赦免我。用你的寶血潔淨我。』你若這樣作，就會立卽被帶回恩典中（新約總論第十册，二七至二八頁）。</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+3">19</td><td><font size="+1">There is no doubt that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ [Eph. 1:3]. But where are these blessings? Brothers and sisters, the main question hinges on faith; we have to believe that God’s Word is true. (CWWN, vol. 24, “The Overcoming Life,” p. 118)</td><td><font size="+1">我們相信神在基督裏，曾用諸天界裏各樣屬靈的福分，祝福了我們〔弗一3〕，但是，這些福分在那裏呢？弟兄姊妹們，所有的問題都在乎信，就是信神的話是真的（得勝的生命，一三九頁）。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+3">20</td><td><font size="+1">The meaning of claiming is to acknowledge daily all that the Lord has accomplished for us, that is, to acknowledge that all these accomplishments are effective in us. Then, when temptation comes, we will live out these accomplishments as if we have already attained to the position (the fact) that the Lord has placed us in. If we do this, our experience will follow. The experience of the believers’ spiritual life is fully based on the facts that God has accomplished for them. The facts are the basis, the experience is the accomplishment, and faith is the process. In other words, the facts are the cause, faith is the way, and experience is the result… Before there can be any lofty spiritual life in the believers, there first must be the perfect work of the Lord Jesus as its wellspring… Sanctification, victory, death, and so forth do not come from self-effort. They come from: (1) acknowledging our sanctification, victory, and death to the self in the Lord Jesus Christ, and (2) practicing it by believing that one is joined to the Lord Jesus in life and that one will be as sanctified, victorious, and dead to the self as the Lord Jesus is. The Lord Jesus has already encountered every experience that we have and will have. To claim by faith is to reckon as ours all that the Lord Jesus has and to apply through an attitude and a conduct of faith all that we have counted as grace.</td><td><font size="+1">支取的意思就是：在乎平常的時候，就承認主所作的都已成功了，祂所成功的對於我必是有效力的；在遇試的時候，就實行出來，一若我是已經得着主所賜給我們的地位（事實）一樣。這樣，經歷隨後就到。…信徒靈性生活的經驗，完全是根據於神爲信徒所成功的事實。事實是根據，經驗是成功，信心是程途。換一句話說，事實是因，信心是法，經驗是果。…在信徒高深靈命的前面，乃是有主耶穌的完全工作爲它的發源地。…要聖別，得勝，死己等等，並非用己力可以得着，乃是承認我在主耶穌基督裏，是聖別的，得勝的，死己的；就實行出來，相信你自己因爲與主耶穌是有生命上的聯合的，所以你必是聖別，得勝，死己，一如主耶穌一樣。我們所有要得着的經驗，都是主耶穌所已經經過了的。信心支取的意思，就是算主耶穌所有的就是我的，並用信心的態度和行爲，使用我所算爲恩典的。</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="white"><td><font size="+3">21</td><td><font size="+1">When we believe in God’s facts shown in the Bible and when we claim these facts, the Holy Spirit will apply to us all the graces that God has accomplished for us in Christ, making them real to us in our lives. In this way, they become our personal experiences. An acknowledging and claiming faith opens the door for the Holy Spirit to work and to apply in our lives all that the Lord Jesus has accomplished so that we will have the practical experience. The work of the Holy Spirit is based upon the facts of God. The Holy Spirit does not accomplish any fact for us; He only makes the things that have been accomplished real and living in our lives. God has accomplished all the facts in Christ. What we must do is acknowledge and claim these facts, trusting in the Holy Spirit to apply in our lives what God has accomplished so that we will have the spiritual experiences. (CWWN, vol. 1, pp. 64-65)</td><td><font size="+1">當我們相信神在聖經裏所表明的事實，而用信心支取的時候，聖靈就將神在基督裏所替我們成功的一切恩典，加在我們的身上，叫它們在我們的生命裏成爲實在，成爲我們個人的經歷。承認和支取的信心，開門叫聖靈作工，將主耶穌所成功的，加在我們的生命裏，叫我們有實踐的經驗。聖靈的工作，都是根據神的事實。聖靈並不爲我們成功甚麼事實，聖靈乃是將所已成功的，在我們的生命裏顯爲實在、活潑的而已。神已經在主耶穌裏成功了事實，我們應當用信心承認、支取這事實，倚靠聖靈，將神所成功的加在我們的生命裏，叫我們有屬靈的經歷（倪柝聲文集第一輯第一册，九四至九五頁）。</td></tr>
